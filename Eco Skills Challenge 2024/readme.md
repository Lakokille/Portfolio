## Eco Skills Challenge 2024 – Sustainable Fertilizer Initiative

Our project promotes a virtuous cycle of sustainable agriculture by developing an affordable, upcycled fertilizer designed to reduce the infiltration of phytosanitary products into the soil. This solution addresses several key environmental challenges, including the stabilization of acid rain levels and the reduction of waterway contamination — a major issue, as nearly €300 million are spent annually on water treatment in France.

Phytosanitary products pose a serious threat to biodiversity, particularly pollinators and aquatic life, due to runoff into rivers and streams. By limiting their impact, our fertilizer contributes to a healthier ecosystem while supporting high agricultural productivity.

**Objective:**  
To encourage a more responsible and sustainable agricultural model — one that protects the environment without compromising production efficiency.
