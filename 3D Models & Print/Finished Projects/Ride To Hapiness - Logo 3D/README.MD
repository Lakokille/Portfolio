# Magnet – Ride to Happiness

## Description
This project features the **Magnet design for “Ride to Happiness”**, available for direct 3D printing. It’s a showcase of my **3D modeling skills and creative design**.  

The design is optimized for **direct printing with Bambulab 3D printers**, making it easy to produce a physical model.  

## Files Included
- **Magnet 3D Print File** – ready-to-print file for Bambulab.  
- **STL Files for Logos** – the two “Ride to Happiness” logos are included as separate STL files.  

## Usage
1. Import the magnet file into your 3D printing software (Bambulab or compatible slicer).  
2. Prepare your printer and start the print directly.  
3. Use the STL logo files for engraving, embedding, or additional customization on the magnet.  

## Notes
- The files are provided in **STL format** for maximum compatibility.  
- The design is ready for printing **without additional modifications**, but you can scale or adjust it if needed.
