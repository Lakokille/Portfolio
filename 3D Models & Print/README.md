Welcome to my 3D portfolio! This folder showcases a variety of my work in **3D modeling, CAD design, and technical prototyping**.  

It includes both **finished projects** and **older or experimental works**, reflecting my learning journey, experimentation, and development in design and modeling.  

## Overview
- Demonstrates skills in **technical 3D modeling and CAD software**.  
- Highlights my ability to **prototype, visualize, and iterate on designs**.  
- Shows both **completed works** and **conceptual or unfinished experiments**, illustrating creativity and progress over time.  

## Structure
- Each project or experiment is organized in its own folder.  
- Assets such as images, 3D models, and CAD files are stored within their respective folders.  
- README files can be included per project for additional details, explanations, or screenshots.
