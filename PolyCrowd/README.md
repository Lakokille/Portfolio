# PolyCrowd – Crowd Simulation

## Description
PolyCrowd is a simulation project designed to model **crowds and queueing systems** in various contexts such as ski stations, tourist attractions, or theme parks.  
It allows experimentation with **different flow optimization strategies** and provides a visual representation of how people move and interact in a given environment.  

This project demonstrates my skills in **C++ programming, simulation design, and visualization with SFML**.

## Features
- Representation of people as moving points in a 2D space  
- Simulation of queues, waiting times, and flows  
- Simple interface with zones of interest (rectangles, areas, or buildings)  
- Multiple optimization strategies:
  - Pre-grouping  
  - Single queues  
  - Fast passes  
  - Monetization of waiting  
- Export of simulation data in **CSV format** for analysis  

## Technologies Used
- **C++** – core programming language  
- **SFML 3** – graphics and event management  
- **TGUI 1.9** – user interface elements  
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** – to manage micro and macro levels  

## How to Build
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/killianblod/PolyCrowd.git
