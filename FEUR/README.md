# FEUR 🚀  

**FEUR (Fusée Expérimentale Ultra Rapide)** is a supersonic experimental rocket project, developed in collaboration with the **CNES**.  
Its objective is to push the boundaries of amateur and academic rocketry through advanced telemetry, high-speed flight, and robust system design.  

## Key Features  
- 🚀 **Supersonic Flight** – capable of reaching **Mach 1.3**.  
- 💥 **Extreme Acceleration** – Simulated up to **33G**.  
- 🛰️ **ESP32-based onboard computer** – ensures efficient data collection and control.  
- 📡 **LoRa Telemetry System** – provides reliable, long-range communication between rocket and ground station.  
- 🖥️ **Custom HMI** – real-time monitoring and visualization of flight parameters.  
- 🤝 **CNES Collaboration** – support for design validation and telemetry integration.  

## Goals  
- Demonstrate a safe and reliable supersonic flight with embedded telemetry.  
- Validate the use of lightweight IoT technologies in extreme aerospace conditions.  
- Provide a framework for future educational and research applications in rocketry.  

## Current Stage  
- ✅ ESP32 firmware development in progress.  
- ✅ LoRa communication pipeline established.  
- 🚧 HMI visualization tools under active development.  
- 🚀 Next step: supersonic flight system validation with RCE1. 

## Vision  
FEUR aims to become a **reference platform for experimental telemetry in rocketry**, bridging the gap between **academic research**, **student projects**, and **professional aerospace applications**.
