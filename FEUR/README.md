# FEUR  

**FEUR** is a research and experimental project focused on telemetry systems.  
It explores how data can be collected, transmitted, and visualized efficiently, with a focus on modular and lightweight design.  

## Overview  
The project aims to:  
- Investigate real-time telemetry collection methods.  
- Develop a scalable framework for data monitoring.  
- Provide insights into system performance through clear visualization tools.  

## Current Stage  
The core telemetry system is functional, with ongoing work to expand its modules and visualization capabilities.  

## Vision  
FEUR is designed as a testbed for telemetry concepts, serving both as a technical experiment and as a foundation for future applications in monitoring, simulation, and real-world systems.
